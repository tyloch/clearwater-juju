# Overview

This charm supports deployment and scaling of the Homer component of a Project Clearwater system.  See http://www.projectclearwater.org for more information on Project Clearwater.

# Usage

The Homer service should be deployed as part of a Clearwater system.  A Clearwater system can be deployed in a Juju environment by creating a config.yaml file then running the following commands.

    juju deploy --config config.yaml clearwater-route53
    juju deploy --config config.yaml --constraints arch=amd64 clearwater-ellis
    juju deploy --config config.yaml --constraints arch=amd64 clearwater-bono
    juju deploy --config config.yaml --constraints arch=amd64 clearwater-sprout
    juju deploy --config config.yaml --constraints arch=amd64 clearwater-homestead
    juju deploy --config config.yaml --constraints arch=amd64 clearwater-homer
    juju add-relation clearwater-ellis clearwater-route53:register-ellis
    juju add-relation clearwater-bono clearwater-route53:register-bono
    juju add-relation clearwater-sprout clearwater-route53:register-sprout
    juju add-relation clearwater-homestead clearwater-route53:register-homestead
    juju add-relation clearwater-homer clearwater-route53:register-homer
    juju expose clearwater-bono
    juju expose clearwater-ellis

The config.yaml configuration file takes the following format.

    clearwater-route53:
      zone: <domain>
      access_key: <ec2 access key>
      secret_key: <ec2 secret access key>
      sas: "0.0.0.0"

    clearwater-ellis:
      smtp_server: smtp.cw-ngv.com
      smtp_username: username
      smtp_password: password
      email_sender: blackhole@cw-ngv.com<mailto:blackhole@cw-ngv.com>
      signup_key: secret
      base_number: "6505550000"
      number_count: 1000
      repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

    clearwater-bono:
      turn_workaround: password
      repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

    clearwater-sprout:
      reg_min_expires: 400
      session_max_expires: 900
      repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

    clearwater-homestead:
      repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

    clearwater-homer:
      repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

Note that the clearwater-homer charm can only be deployed on the `amd64` architecture.

## Scale out Usage

## Known Limitations and Issues

The only currently supported DNS service for Clearwater is clearwater-route53 (when deploying in Amazon EC2), so will currently only work on EC2.  Additional DNS services will be added for other environments in future.

clearwater-homer currently only supports running as a single unit.  Clustering support will be released shortly, which will allow units to be added to and removed from a clearwater-homer deployment using juju add-unit and juju remove-unit commands.

# Configuration

Clearwater has a number of configuration fields which are non-defaultable.  These are as follows.

clearwater-route53

-  `zone:` This must be set to a DNS zone name which is managed by the AWS Route53 service.
-  `access_key:` and `secret_key:` These must be set to the AWS access key and secret key of the AWS account which owns the DNS zone name.

clearwater-ellis

-  `signup_key:` This is used as a signup key on the Ellis self-provisioning portal, so should be set to a unique string for each installation.
-  `base_number:` and `number_count:` These define the telephone number range assigned to the Clearwater system.
